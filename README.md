# BYU Views Card
Creates a views plugin for the BYU Card component so you can display views content as BYU Cards.

## Usage

When you create your view, simply pick the BYU Card style from the list of display styles. You will then be asked to input a few options:

* **Number of tiles in each row** - Determines how many cards will be in a row.
* **Tile Alignment** - Determines how the cards are aligned within the view.
* **Border** - Determines the color of the border. You can choose no border, gray, or a navy blue.
* **Border Radius** - Determines how big the rounded corner on the cards should be. Picking "None" will simply result in a square corner.
